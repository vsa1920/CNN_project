README File

Instructions to run the code:-

1) The training was done on Google colab and the data is read through a mounted Google drive. Link - https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1y_UyGXBZqJNrgHgx-nqTO2OaVWAbPefA?usp=sharing - A copy of the notebook is also available in this directory but can't be run from here as the colab notebook takes in data through the Drive.
2) The inference script can be run indepedently with the two models, which are saved as "best_model" - Model with SE layers and "cnn" - Model without SE layers
3) To run the model on any sample, add it to the Images folder and run the inference script.
